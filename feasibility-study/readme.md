# Feasibility study

This folder contains python notebooks used in the feasibility study. The feasibility study is part of the literature review for my thesis on sensor fusion for height estimation of hydrofoil ships. For more information on this feasibility study, please refer to the relevant chapter in the literature review report.

## Files

- **poc-single-case-study.ipynb** — Notebook for analyzing a single test case in detail, including a large amount of plots and explanations to show how this simulation works. Useful to research and understand behaviour of the filters on a specific test case.
- **poc-multi-case-table-generator.ipynb** — Notebook which calculates mean error, RMS error and Equvalent Estimator Acceleration (EEA) for a number of test cases, and outputs the results in a table format.
- **h_eta_definition.png** — Diagram explaining the definition of *h* and *η* used in the analyses.

## Notes
Please note that the goal of this feasibility study is only to test if the thesis objective and methodology are feasible, and not to test what the actual performance of the fusion algorithms is. Algorithm proposals, analysis, simulation cases and interpretation of results are very limited, as this is left for the main thesis report.
